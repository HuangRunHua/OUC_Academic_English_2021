## Syllabus Assignment

1. I, Runhua Huang(黄润华) have read and understand the Syllabus for Academic English.
2. After reading the Syllabus, I am look forward to the  Lesson "Verbs-How to use them correctly". I have published some iOS software development tutorials on the Medium platform, but due to my English proficiency, the words and grammar of the article are too childish, and I even made a fatal verb usage error in an article. At that time, I used the word "click" to describe the pressing operation of our fingers on the phone. Later, some enthusiastic readers reminded me at the end of the article and told me that I should use the word "tap", it was really embarrassing.
3. My Clear Goal this semester: I hope I have the courage to participate every class during the semester. I consider myself a shy boy which makes me single until now.
