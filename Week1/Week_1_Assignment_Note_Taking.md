## Note Taking

1. During this semester I am planning to use "Mind Map/Brainstorm + Outline" note taking method.
2. Reason: During undergraduate, I discovered an app--"Xmind" and fell in love with the way it told me how to take a quick and effective note, it's really concise, the key points are clear at a glance.
3. Yes, I love this  Note Taking Method.
4. This PowerPoint illustrates that Note Taking by keyboard is less useful than Note Taking in a pen. For myself, when I use the computer to take notes, all of my attention will focus on where the letters are on the keyboard, so sometimes miss many key points during a lesson. So I really agree with the idea.
